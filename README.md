## Linting

This project includes tight **ESLint** rules to ensure quality code. Many of the rules favor a functional approach with a strong emphasis on immutability and strong type definitions. Please visit the `.eslintrc.js` file to get a full list of the rules that are applied.

The **ESLint** rules are listed as key/value pairs. The key represents the rule name and the value (number) represents the setting of the rule:

| 0   |  1   |   2   |
| --- | :--: | :---: |
| off | warn | error |

Here is an example of a rule:

```
"immutable/no-this": 2
```

This particular rule disallows the use of the `this` keyword, which will result in an error.

## Styling

This library is pre-configured to work with **Styled-Components** and works with the `css` prop:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <h1
      css={`
        color: #333;
      `}
    >
      Hello World!
    </h1>
  </div>
);
```

## Storybook

Storybook is available by creating stories in the `src/stories` directory and running the `npm run storybook` script. Your storybook will be availble at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

You can also compile a production build of your Storybook by running `npm run build:storybook`. The compiled production build will be located in a `/storybook-static` directory.

## Deployment

Lint your files and fix all linting issues.

```sh
npm run lint
```

Run your test suite and fix any broken tests.

```sh
npm run test
```

Compile a production build to the `/public` directory.

```sh
npm run build
```
